Covert remote desktop POC for Windows. Uses DXGI's DDAPI for capture on Windows 8 and above. This isn't available on ealier versions of Windows so BitBlt is used in these cases. Keyboard and mouse input supported, except for dragging.

The TCP support is finished and HTTPs only needs a few tweaks.

Note that keyboard and mouse IO is commented out by default. To enable it check io/iodriver.go. This is because when the client and server is run on the same machine the mouse is glitched around by the "loopback" messaging, making the computer impossible to use until the application has exited. To test this functionality run the client in a VM or another machine.
